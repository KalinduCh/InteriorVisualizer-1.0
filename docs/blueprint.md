## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted blue (#6699CC) to evoke a sense of reliability and precision, crucial for construction calculations.
- Background color: A light gray (#F0F0F0), desaturated to 20%, provides a clean and unobtrusive backdrop, allowing the primary color to stand out.
- Accent color: A warm orange (#FF9933) to highlight key actions and results. The warmer hue stands out well against the cooler blues and grays.
